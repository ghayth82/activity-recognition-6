# Human activity recognition based on gyroscope data

[Activity Recognition.ipynb](https://github.com/silaslenz/activity-recognition/blob/master/Activity%20Recognition.ipynb) contains the actual classifiers.

[Visual analysis and stats.ipynb](https://github.com/silaslenz/activity-recognition/blob/master/Visual%20analysis%20and%20stats.ipynb) contains manual visual analysis and statistics of the dataset.

[report.pdf](https://github.com/silaslenz/activity-recognition/blob/master/report.pdf) is, well, a report.

[datareader.py](https://github.com/silaslenz/activity-recognition/blob/master/datareader.py) is used to read the csv files and slightly process them (splitting into chunks, generating features) into data usable for classification.
